  <h2>Introduction and Fundamental Concepts</h2>
  <main>

    If we apply a tagential force or a shear stress to a solid, it goes a definite deformation. Even if shear stress exists, the solid may be under equilibrium with a particular deformation. If we lift the load, it may or may not completely regain its shape within certain limit.
    <br/>
    <br/>But if a tangential force is applied toa fluid body, it goes on continuously deforming (one cannot make fluid at rest) and it goes on deforming continuously.
    <br/>
    <br/>Solid can resist the shear force or shear stress under static equilibrium condition with the finite derormation and it can regain its original shape or partly its original shape when the load is relieved.
    <br/>
    <br/>Whereas fluid goes on continuously deforming which means that fluid resist tangentail force only on the dynamic condition. It cannot resist tangential stress under static condition. It resists tangential stress but while resistingit goes on moving continuously. Also, if we relieve or take off the load, the fluid cannot come back to its original shape (fluid is zero memory susbtance). The exception is viscoelastic fluid which posseses partly elastic property.
    <br/>
    <br/>As the constituitive equation relates stress and strain in solid, the constituitiveequation of fluid realtes stress with the rate of strain.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <b>Concept of Continuum - </b>Matter is composed of molecules and we assume that they are continuously in touch with each other. Practically it is quite true for solids and liquids. Also it is very true for gas as well.
    <br/>
    <br/> The distance between the molecules is characterised by
    <b>mean free path (\( \lambda \))</b>. Mean free path is statistically average distance the molecule travels between two successive collisions. The measure of \( \lambda \) relative to the characteristic dimesion of the problem defines whether continuum will be valid or not. Therefore it comes by the concept of relative magnitude of this mean free path with the chracteristic dimension of the problem.
    <br/>
    <br/>So if we consider \( \lambda \) as mean free path and \( L \) as the characteristic dimension of the problem the fraction \( \lambda /L \) is known as Knudsen Number.
